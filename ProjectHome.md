Utility of Time aims to culminate the knowledge gained by the Zelda 64 hacking community into an easy to use and intuitive, graphically driven application. Written in VB.NET (2008) and OpenGL through the Tao Framework binding.

Currently, it is designed around the Ocarina of Time Debugger's ROM (it does technically support all N64 Zelda formatted levels and models, but certain usability features are exclusive to the Debug version), with expansion to normal OoT ROMs/Majora's Mask planned.

Portions of the code are quite messy, and completely uncommented. Feel free to modify and redistribute as you wish, but if you make a worthwhile change, be sure to request commiter status!
